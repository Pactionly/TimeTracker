# TimeTracker

Liatrio Time Tracking Project for the Hello DevOps section in the Liatrio DevOps Bootcamp

## Goals

We'd like to reduce the amount of time it takes to record working hours in the office. This web app aims to provide a convenient interface to simply clock-in and clock-out as well as provide relevant metrics on your current workweek.

The main features we plan to implement are as follows:

- Update and edit Google Sheet containing our current work history
- Display upcoming calendar events
- Generate metrics on work hours for the day and the sum of hours worked during the pay period
- Provide helpul graphs to visualize important metrics

We hope to gain a greater understanding of developing software projects as a team while utilizing DevOps principles to improve our workflow and time to production.
